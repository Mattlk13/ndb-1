# ndb - the node debugger

A command line node.js/v8 debugger.  It is still in beta, but perfectly usable.

# NOT MAINTAINED

This project is no longer being maintained.  Use the built in debugger in versions of node >= 0.4.x.

If there are features that you are relying on in ndb that aren't present in the built in debugger, I'd be happy to port them to the mainline debugger; just file a ticket in this project.
